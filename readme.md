# Movie Collaboration Network ‚Äì SI 507 Final Project

## üîç Project Selection & Motivation (Part A)

**Project:** Movie Collaboration Network  
**Goal:** To explore how professional relationships in the film industry influence success and influence.  
**Motivation:** I want to visualize how actors, directors, and producers are interconnected across movies, and analyze how working with well-connected people affects things like box office success. This network-based approach will help answer:  
- Who are the most central people in the industry?
- Do certain cliques dominate movie collaborations?
- Is there a ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù between distant collaborators?

---

## üì¶ Dataset & API Usage (Part B)

**APIs used:**
- [TMDb API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)
- Box Office earnings from TMDb (used instead of Box Office Mojo)

**Data Access Proven (see screenshots to attach):**
- Raw TMDb API response for `/movie/{id}` and `/movie/{id}/credits`
- Sample graph output in terminal
- List of all people in the graph saved to `people_in_graph.txt`
- NetworkX graph visualization for specific movie

**Sample File Accessed:**
- `tmdb_api.py`: connects to TMDb API
- `build_graph.py`: constructs the collaboration graph
- `main.py`: handles CLI interface

## üßë‚Äçüíª User Interactions Implemented (Part C)

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ Find most frequent collaborators | Enter a person‚Äôs name and see who they worked with the most, with movie titles & counts |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ Find shortest connection with movies | Compute a collaboration path between two people with movie details |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ View collaboration network for a movie | Visualize the network of collaborators in a single film |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ List all people in the graph | Print or filter people by role (actor, director, etc.), supports export |
| ‚úÖ Bonus: Community Detection | Groups of closely collaborating people (in progress) |

## üñº Screenshot Requirements (Part D.1)

> üìå Attach these:
- Terminal screenshot showing successful API response in Python
- Graph image or CLI output from ‚Äúmost frequent collaborators‚Äù
- View of `people_in_graph.txt` saved file

---

## ‚ùì Questions for Myself (Part D.2)

1. Should I integrate actual movie genres and show how genre affects collaboration?
2. Do I need to limit my network to only lead cast members?
3. Should I include awards or popularity scores from TMDb as node weights?

---

## ü§î Instructor Note (Part D.3)

I am confident in my current direction and have no major questions for the instructor right now.

## üß† Notes

- Data is stored locally; caching is being added
- Final deliverables will include video demo, full project report, and clean repo
